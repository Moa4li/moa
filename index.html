          <p>It tells how a child’s realisation of his special talent while kicking a ball around with friends on Huyton’s Bluebell estate, morphed into a man’s realisation of his dream of becoming his club’s talisman.</p>

          <p>The stats will only tell half the story. The hero worship from Liverpool supporters from every inch of the earth tells the rest.</p>

          <p>Steven Gerrard isn’t just another player to have donned the red jersey – more than any other he’s epitomised the values and character of Liverpool Football Club.</p>

          <p>He’s dedicated every piece of his fibre to the club’s cause over the last quarter of a century and leaves Anfield as a bonafide legend.</p>

          <p>Many dream the dream. Steven Gerrard has lived it.</p>

            It was in the little square in front of Steven’s house on Ironside Road in the Bluebell Estate of Huyton, Liverpool that his first football battles were won. They may not be as well known as the glory nights at Anfield, Wembley, or the Ataturk stadium,
            but for Steven they were just as important then as those world famous occasions would be later.

          </p>

          <p>
            For it was on these streets outside his home where that passion, that self-belief, that drive to win, were gleaned and fostered.
          </p>
          <p>
            And right from the start it was obvious to see. He soon found himself playing with his elder brother, Paul, in the primary school team two years above his age group.
